<h2>What is HanDeDict?</h2>

<p>HanDeDict is an open-source, collaboratively edited Chinese-German dictionary, licensed under Create Commons
(<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/de/" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 2.0 DE</a>).
It started out as a translation of the CEDICT Chinese-English dictionary, and was
actively maintained with the support of the
<a href="http://www.chinaboard.de/willkommen.html" target="_blank">Chinesisch-Deutsche Gesellschaft e.V.
Hamburg</a> between 2006 and 2011. In August 2015, the website of HanDeDict went offline; the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325174145/http:/www.handedict.de/chinesisch_deutsch.php?mode=about" target="_blank">last snapshot</a>
on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine is from August 1, 2015. The text file that contains the
entire dictionary in its most recent form can be
<a href="https://github.com/zydeo/HanDeDict/" target="_blank">downloaded from Github.</a>
The website you are viewing now is based on this file.</p>

<h2>What is Zydeo?</h2>

<p>In its original form, <a href="https://zydeo.net/" target="_blank">Zydeo</a>
is an open-source Chinese-English dictionary for Windows, based on
<a href="http://cc-cedict.org/wiki/" target="_blank">CC-CEDICT</a>.
I created it for my own delight, as a hobby project that allowed me to explore
a minimalist approach to user interfaces. Occasionally, I post about it over on the
<a href="https://blog.zydeo.net/" target="_blank">Zydeo blog</a>. You can find the
<a href="https://github.com/zydeo/Zydeo" target="_blank">source code</a> on Github.</p>

<p>I did not consider creating an online version for its own sake; there are countless websites
built on CEDICT out there. But I will soon launch a project similar to HanDeDict: a translation
of CEDICT into a different language, open for collaborative editing. When I learned that the
HanDeDict website disappeared, I realized I could repurpose existing work and launch
this site to make HanDeDict available online again. The result is HanDeDict @ Zydeo.</p>

<h2>The future</h2>

<p>In its current, initial form, this website allows you to search HanDeDict. I will be releasing
small improvements over the next months. In particular, the handwriting recognition component
(based on a port of Jordan Kiang's
<a href="http://www.kiang.org/jordan/software/hanzilookup/" target="_blank">HanziLookup</a>
by <a href="http://jabtunes.com/notation/chinesestroke.html" target="_blank">Zz85</a>)
could use some love.
</p>

<p>Eventually the site will include an online editor that allows everyone to improve translations
and add new headwords. I hope to attract contributors who will resurrect HanDeDict and continue
to expand and improve it from where the original team of creators left off in 2011.</p>
